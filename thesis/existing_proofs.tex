For a graph $H$ define the family of graphs not containing an induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$ as $\textit{Forb}(H)$. For which $H$ can we find a function $f$ such that $\chi (G)\leq f(\omega (G))$ holds for every graph $G\in\textit{Forb}(H)$? I.e., by the notation in \ref{d1}, we want to find a bounding function for $\textit{Forb}(H)$. If $f$ exists, let us call $H$ $\chi $-bounding. Observe that if $H$ is $\chi $-bounding, $H$ must be acyclic. That is because of a result by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal in \cite{EH66} showing the existence of graphs with arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number. Thus, if $H$ contains a cycle, we can always find a graph $G$ with girth greater than the longest cycle in $H$ and a large chromatic number. Therefore, it is impossible to find a bounding function for $\textit{Forb}(H)$. For every acyclic graph $H^\prime$ the family $\mathcal{F}(H^\prime )$ may be $\chi$-bounded. Indeed, Gyárfás \cite{Gy75} and Sumner \cite{Su81} independently conjectured that it is true for every forest.

\begin{con}[Gyárfás \cite{Gy75}, Sumner \cite{Su81}]\label{c1cr}
Every forest $F$ is $\chi$-bounding.
\end{con}

Actually, Gyárfás and Sumner conjectured that for every clique $K$ and tree $T$ the family of graphs inducing neither $K$ nor $T$ is $\chi$-bounded. Martin \cite{Ma16} mentions the general idea for proving that both statements are equivalent. He claims that the problem as formulated in the Conjecture \ref{c1cr} can be reduced to trees since a forest is $\chi$-bounding if and only if all its connected components are $\chi$-bounding. Then, \ref{c1cr} just states the Gyárfás-Sumner conjecture using Definition \ref{d1}. We give a proof of this claim.

\begin{thm}
A forest $F$ is $\chi$-bounding if and only if all its connected components are $\chi$-bounding.
\end{thm}

\begin{prf}
Let $F$ be a $\chi$-bounding forest with a bounding function $f$. Assume there exists a connected component $T$ of $F$ that is not $\chi$-bounding. Then, for all functions $g:\N\to\N$ there exist an $\omega\in\N$ and a graph $G\in \textit{Forb}(T)$ with $\omega (G)=\omega$ and $\chi (G)>g(\omega)$ by Definition \ref{d1}. Now let $g:=f$. Since any graph in $\textit{Forb}(T)\subseteq\textit{Forb}(F)$, there exist an $\omega\in\N$ and a graph $G\in\textit{Forb}(F)$ with $\omega (G) =\omega $ and $\chi (G)>f(\omega )$. This is a contradiction to $F$ being $\chi$-bounding.

To show the other direction, let $F$ be a forest with connected components $T_1, T_2,\dots ,T_k$ where $\textit{Forb}	(T_i)$ is $\chi$-bounded with a bounding function $f_i$, $i\in [k]$. Assume, $F$ is not $\chi$-bounding, i.e. for all functions $g:\N\to\N$ there exist an $\omega\in\N$ and a graph $G\in \textit{Forb}(F)$ with $\omega (G)=\omega$ and $\chi (G)>g(\omega)$. Let $g$ be a function with $g(\omega )\geq\max_{i\in [k]}f_i(\omega )$ for all $\omega\in\N$ and choose a graph $G\in\textit{Forb}(F)$ with $\chi (G)>g(\omega)$. Then, there exists an $i\in [k]$ such that $G\in\textit{Forb}(T_i)$ and $\chi (G)>g(\omega )\geq f_i(\omega )$. This contradicts the assumption that $T_i$ is $\chi$-bounding.\qed
\end{prf}

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of graphs and let $\textit{Forb}(\mathcal{H})$ be the family of graphs forbidding any graph in $\mathcal{H}$ as an induced subgraph. The Conjecture \ref{c1cr} covers only cases where $\vert\mathcal{H}\vert =1$.
Now consider a family $\textit{Forb}(\mathcal{H})$ with $\vert\mathcal{H}\vert >1$. Note that every finite set containing a forest is $\chi$-bounding under the assumption that Conjecture \ref{c1cr} is true and if $\mathcal{H}$ is finite and $\chi$-bounding it must contain a forest because of the result by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal \cite{EH66}. If $\mathcal{H}$ does not contain a forest, it has to be infinite. Thus, considering infinite sets of cycles is the next obvious step. In 1985, Gyárfás made three more conjectures (later published in \cite{Gy87}) concerning the relation between the chromatic number of a graph and the length of cycles it induces.
\begin{con}[Gyárfás \cite{Gy87}]
The following three statements hold.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The family of graphs with no induced cycle of odd length is $\chi$-bounded.
\item Let $l\in\N$. The family of graphs with no induced cycle of length at least $l$ is $\chi$-bounded.
\item Let $l\in\N$. The family of graphs with no induced cycle of odd length at least $l$ is $\chi$-bounded.
\end{enumerate}
\end{con}

Observe that the third conjecture implies the first two but since they were stated and proven independently each seems to be worth a nomination on its own. Chudnovsky, Scott and Seymour dealt with these conjectures in a series of papers including three (\cite{SS14}, \cite{CSS15} and \cite{CSSS17}) in which they are proving them.
\\

Returning to the case were $\vert\mathcal{H}\vert =1$, it might be interesting to note that the conjecture becomes a rather simple problem in the case of general subgraphs instead of induced subgraphs. There exists a proof of an even stronger result by Gyárfás, Szemeredi and Tuza from 1980 \cite{GST80}. They show that a labeled tree $T$ on $k$ vertices is a subgraph of any labeled graph with chromatic number at least $k$. A \textit{labeled} graph is a graph with an assignment of labels, often represented by integers, to its vertices. When talking about a labeled graph $G$ without defining an explicit labeling, we refer to a graph labeled such that each vertex has a unique label. Usually each vertex has a label $i\in [\vert V(G)\vert ]$. A pair of labeled graphs is isomorphic if there exists a graph isomorphism that also heeds the assigned labels besides the structure of the graph.

An obvious consequence of this theorem is that the family of graphs that do not contain $T$ as a subgraph is $\chi$-bounded and for the bounding function $f$ holds $f(\omega )\equiv k$.

\begin{thm}[Gyárfás, Szemeredi, Tuza \cite{GST80}]\label{t4cr}
Let $k\in\N$ and $G$ be a labeled graph with $\chi (G) = k$. Then, $G$ contains every labeled tree $T$ on $k$ vertices as a subgraph. 
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
We proof this by induction on $k$. For the base case let $k=1$. A graph $G$ with $\chi (G)=1$ trivially contains a labeled tree on a single vertex.

Now let $k>1$ and suppose the statement holds for all $1\leq k^\prime <k$. Consider a graph $G$ with $\chi (G) = k$ and a proper coloring $c$ in $k$ colors. Let its vertices be labeled with $1, 2, \dots , k$ according to their color under $c$. Let $T$ be a labeled tree on $k$ vertices. Choose a leaf $p$ of $T$ and call its neighbor $q$. Denote the label of $p$ as $l_p$ and the label of $q$ as $l_q$. Let $A$ be the set of vertices of $G$ with color $l_q$ such that each vertex in $A$ has a neighbor with color $l_p$. The set $A$ is not empty since $\chi (G)=k$. Consider the subgraph $G^\prime$ of $G$ where we remove the vertices of the color class $l_p$ and the vertices of color class $l_q$ that are not in $A$. It is a graph with chromatic number $k-1$ and by induction hypothesis it contains a labeled tree $T^\prime$ isomorphic to $T-\lbrace p\rbrace$. Since the vertex mapped to $q$ under the isomorphism is element of $A$, it has a neighbor $x\in V(G)$ with color $l_p$ and $T^\prime\cup\lbrace x\rbrace$ is isomorphic to $T$.\qed
\end{prf}
\begin{cor}\label{cor1cr}
A graph $G$ with $\chi (G) = k$ contains every tree $T$ on $k$ vertices as a subgraph. 
\end{cor}
\begin{prf}
A tree $T$ on $k$ vertices can be seen as a labeled tree on $k$ vertices. Thus, $T\subseteq G$ holds by Theorem \ref{t4cr}.\qed
\end{prf}

\begin{cor}
For a tree $T$, the family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs not containing $T$ as a subgraph is $\chi$-bounded with a bounding function $f_T$ satisfying $f_T(\omega )\leq\vert T\vert$.
\end{cor}
\begin{prf}
The chromatic number of any graph $G\in\mathcal{F}$ is at most $\vert T\vert$ by Corollary \ref{cor1cr}.\qed
\end{prf}

The actual Gyárfas-Sumner conjecture, i.e. Conjecture \ref{c1cr}, for induced subgraphs remains open. Even though many tried to prove the conjecture for over forty years, there are only some trees found to be $\chi$-bounding so far. 

Note that finding a counterexample for Conjecture \ref{c1cr} is not easy either. As the following result shows, considering a random large graph and a tree $T$ does not work since the graph contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to $T$ with asymptotic probability $1$. For our purpose, a \textit{random} graph is a graph where each edge is independently determined to be present with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. For a graph property $P$ let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the family of graphs with this property. Let $G$ be a random graph on $n$ vertices. We say \textit{almost all graphs} have property $P$ if $Prob(G\in\mathcal{P})\xlongrightarrow{{n\to\infty}} 1$.
\begin{thm}
Let $T$ be a tree. Almost all graphs contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to $T$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
Let $T$ be a tree on $k$ vertices and $G$ be a random graph on $n\geq k$ vertices. Observe that a vertex set $H\subseteq V(G)$ of size $k$ induces a graph isomorphic to $T$ with a strictly positive probability $p$ since all edges between vertices in $H$ are present with probabilitiy $\frac{1}{2}$. For the probability of $G$ containing an induced subgraph isomorphic to $T$ then holds:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\textit{Prob}(T\subseteq_I G) &= 1-\textit{Prob}(T\nsubseteq_I G)\\
&=1-\textit{Prob}(G[H]\not\approx T \hspace{0.4em}\forall H\subseteq V(G), \vert H\vert =k)\\
&=1-\prod_{H\in {V\choose k}}\textit{Prob}(G[H]\not\approx T)\\
&=1-\prod_{H\in {V\choose k}} (1-p)\\
&=1-(1-p)^{n\choose k}\xlongrightarrow{{n\to\infty}} 1
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\qed
\end{prf}
Thus, we require a special construction to find a graph without an induced subgraph isomorphic to $T$ but with an arbitrarily large chromatic number and therefore many vertices. As mentioned in the introduction, we consider two constructions in Chapters \ref{secMy} and \ref{secLS}.

Continuing with the proofs that already exist, here is a list of them as stated by Chudnovsky, Scott and Seymour in \cite{CSS17} including the cases they proved in the same paper.

\begin{thm}\label{t3cr}
The following trees are $\chi$-bounding:
\begin{itemize}
\item trees of radius at most two (Kierstead and Penrice \cite{Ki94}),
\item trees obtained from a tree with radius at most two by subdividing every edge incident to the root exactly once (Kierstead and Zhu \cite{Ki04}),
\item subdivisions of stars (Scott \cite{Sc97}),
\item trees obtained by adding one vertex to a subdivided star (Chudnovsky, Scott and Seymour \cite{CSS17}),
\item trees obtained from a sudivided star and a star by adding a path joining their centers (Chudnovsky, Scott and Seymour \cite{CSS17}).
\end{itemize} 
\end{thm}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{chi_bounding_trees}
\end{center}
\caption{Tree $T_1$ with root $r$ that is obtained from a radius-two tree by subdividing every edge incident to the root exactly once, a tree $T_2$ that is a subdivided star with one additional leaf $v$ and a tree $T_3$ obtained from joining the centers of a star and a subdivided star by a path}
\label{f2cr}
\end{figure}

See Figure \ref{f2cr} for trees serving as examples for the second, fourth and fifth result of Theorem \ref{t3cr}. Even if we do not provide the proofs for all these cases, know that the third result is an implication of the topological version of the Gyárfás-Sumner conjecture that has been proved by Scott in \cite{Sc97}. Obviously, the case of subdivided stars is included in the fourth result but since it was proven a long time before the fourth result it is worth a nomination on its own.

\begin{thm}[Scott \cite{Sc97}]
For each tree $T$, there exists a function $f:\N\to\N$ such that for all graphs $G$ not containing an induced subgraph that is a subdivision of $T$ $\chi (G)\leq f(\omega (G))$.
\end{thm}

If $T$ is a subdivision of a star, every graph that is a subdivision of $T$ contains an induced copy of $T$. Thus, no graph in $\textit{Forb}(T)$ contains an induced subgraph that is a subdivision of $T$. This proves the third result in Theorem \ref{t3cr}.\\

Instead of presenting the proofs for the other results, we now consider the cases of stars and paths. First, they provide an approach for proving some cases of the conjecture and second, they may serve as a reference for some results following in the other chapters of this thesis. The two following theorems proved by Gyárfás in \cite{Gy87} show that the families of graphs $\textit{Forb}(K_{1,n})$ and $\textit{Forb}(P_n)$ are $\chi$-bounded and even provide a lower bound on the bounding function in the first case.

\begin{thm}[Gyárfás \cite{Gy87}] The family of graphs $\textit{Forb}(K_{1,n})$ is $\chi$-bounded for all fixed $n \in\N$, $n\geq 2$, with a bounding function $f_n$ satisfying \[\dfrac{R(n,\omega + 1) - 1}{n-1}\leq f_n(\omega )\leq R(n,\omega ).\] 
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
We prove the lower bound first. By definition of the Ramsey number, there is a graph on $R(n,\omega + 1) - 1$ vertices that contains no stable set of $n$ vertices and no clique of $\omega + 1$ vertices. Let $G$ be such a graph. Then, $G$ does not contain a $K_{1,n}$, since its leaves would form a stable set of $n$ vertices. Additionally, $\chi (G)\geq |V(G)| /(n-1)$ holds because every color class is a stable set. This gives the lower bound.

To prove the upper bound, let $G \in\textit{Forb} (K_{1,n})$ and $\omega (G) = \omega$. Assume, there exists a vertex $v\in V(G)$ with degree $R(n,\omega)$. Then, the neighborhood of $v$ either contains a stable set of $n$ vertices or a clique of $\omega$ vertices. In the first case, the stable set and $v$ would induce a $K_{1,n}$ in $G$. The second case contradicts $\omega (G) = \omega$. Thus, the maximum degree $\Delta (G)$ of $G$ is less than $R(n,\omega)$, i.e. a greedy coloring of $G$ yields $\chi (G)\leq\Delta (G) + 1\leq R(n,\omega)$.\qed
\end{prf}

\begin{thm}[Gyárfás \cite{Gy87}]
For all fixed $n\in\N$, $n\geq 2$, the family of graphs $\textit{Forb}(P_n)$ is $\chi$-bounded with a bounding function $f_n(\omega )\leq (n-1)^{\omega - 1}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{prf}
Let $n\in\N$ be fixed let $G$ be a graph with $\omega (G)=\omega$ such that $P_n\nsubseteq_I G$. We prove that $\chi (G)\leq (n-1)^{\omega -1}$ by induction on $\omega (G)$. Consider the base case for $\omega (G) =1$. Then, $\chi (G) = 1$ and the theorem trivially holds.

Suppose the theorem holds for all graphs $G^\prime\in\textit{Forb}(P_n)$ with $\omega (G^\prime ) \leq t$ for some $t\geq 1$, i.e. $(n-1)^{t-1}$ is a bounding function for them. Let $G\in\textit{Forb}(P_n)$ with $\omega (G) = t + 1$. Now, assume that $\chi (G) > (n-1)^{\omega - 1}$. We shall reach a contradiction by constructing an induced path $Q_n=(q_1,q_2,\dots ,q_n)$ in $G$. To do this, we will define subgraphs $G_i$ of $G$ with $q_i\in V(G_i)$ for all $i\in [n]$, such that $V(G_1)\supseteq V(G_2)\supseteq \dots\supseteq V(G_n)$ and each $G_i$ satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $G_i$ is connected,
\item $\chi (G_i) > (n-i)(n-1)^{t-1}$,
\item for $1\leq j<i$ and $v\in V(G_i)$ $q_jv$ is an edge in $G$ if and only if $i=j+1$ and $v = q_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $G_1$ be a connected component of $G$ with $\chi (G_1) >(n-1)^t$ and let $q_1$ be any vertex of $G_1$. For $i>1$ assume that $G_1,G_2,\dots , G_{i-1}$ and $q_1,q_2,\dots , q_{i-1}$ are already defined and satisfy the wanted properties. Let $A$ denote the neighborhood of $q_{i-1}$ in $G_{i-1}$ and let $B=V(G_{i-1})\setminus (A\cup\{q_{i-1}\})$. Refer to Figure \ref{f1cr} for a visualization of the vertex subsets $A$ and $B$ in $G$. Note that $A$ does not necessarily have to be a stable set as depicted in the figure. The graph $G[A]$ induced by $A$ in $G$ satisfies $\omega (G[A])\leq t$ because a larger clique and $q_{i-1}$ would induce a clique larger than $t+1$ in $G$. Thus, we have $\chi (G[A])\leq (n-1)^{t-1}$ by induction hypothesis.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{path_general}
\end{center}
\caption{Construction of an induced path $Q_i$ in $G$}
\label{f1cr}
\end{figure}


Assume, $B\neq\emptyset$. Observe that $\chi (G_{i-1})\leq \chi (G[A]) + \chi (G[B])$ since proper colorings of $G[A]$ and $G[B]$ in distinct colors and assigning $q_i$ any color used in $V(G[B])$ defines a proper coloring of $G_{i-1}$. Thus, \[\chi (G[B])\geq \chi (G_{i-1})-\chi (G[A])>(n-i+1)(n-1)^{t-1}-(n-1)^{t-1}=(n-i)(n-1)^{t-1}.\]
Therefore, there exists a connected component $H$ of $G[B]$ with $\chi (H)>(n-i)(n-1)^{t-1}$. Recall, that $G_{i-1}$ is connected, i.e. there also exists a vertex $q_i\in A$ such that $V(H)\cup \{q_i\}$ induces a connected subgraph $H^\prime$. We choose $q_i$ as the new vertex in the path $Q_i$ and $H^\prime$ as $G_i$. Then, $G_i$ obviously satisfies $(i)$ and $(ii)$. Since the only edge between $V(Q_{i-2})$ and $V(G_{i-1})$ is $q_{i-1}q_{i-2}$, there is no edge at all between $V(Q_{i-2})$ and $q_i$ and by definition the edge $q_{i-1}q_i$ exists. Thus, $(iii)$ is satisfied as well. 

If $B=\emptyset$, $\chi (G_{i-1})\leq \chi (G[A]) + 1$. By property $(ii)$ of $G_{i-1}$, $(n-i+1)(n-1)^{t-1} < (n-1)^{t-1} +1$ holds. Since $n\geq 2$ we have $i=n$ and we choose $q_n$ as any vertex of $A$. Note that $A\neq\emptyset$ by properties $(i)$ and $(ii)$ of $G_{i-1}$. With $G_n=\{q_n\}$ we are done.\qed
\end{prf}


Observe that if we weaken Conjecture \ref{c1cr} by making more requirements for the graphs that are supposed to contain the induced subgraphs that simplifies certain proofs greatly. Rather than presenting some other proofs concerning cases of the Gyárfás-Sumner conjecture, the next theorem shows that presuming a certain girth and minimum degree in a graph assures the existence of induced subgraphs isomorphic to some trees. 

\begin{thm}
Let $T$ be a tree on $k\in\N$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta (T)=d$. A graph $G$ with girth $g$ such that $k+1\leq g<\infty$ and minimum degree $\delta (G)\geq d$ contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to $T$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
We prove this by induction on $k$. If $k=1$, $T$ is a tree on a single vertex. A graph $G$ with girth $2\leq g<\infty$ has at least one vertex. Choose any vertex in $G$. The graph induced by this vertex is isomorphic to $T$.

For $k\geq 2$, $T$ is a tree on at least $2$ vertices. Thus, we choose a leaf $l$ of $T$ and call the vertex that $l$ is adjacent to $u$. Let $G$ be a graph with girth $k+1\leq g<\infty$ and minimum degree $\delta (G)\geq d$. Now consider $T^\prime = T-\{l\}$. The graph $T^\prime$ is a tree on $k-1$ vertices with maximum degree still at most $d$. By induction hypothesis holds $T^\prime\subseteq_I G$. Let $\varphi$ be the map, that embeds $T^\prime$ in $G$. Since $\delta (G)\geq d$ and $u$ has degree at most $d-1$ in $T^\prime$, we find a vertex $v\in V(G)$ adjacent to $\varphi (u)$ that is not part of the embedding of $T^\prime$ in $G$ with $\varphi$. Then,
\[\varphi^\prime :V(T)\to V(G), \varphi^\prime (w)=\begin{cases}v&\text{if }w=l,\\ \varphi (w) &\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]
defines an embedding of $T$ in $G$. To verify that $\varphi^\prime (T)$ is indeed an induced subgraph we need to show that $v$ is not adjacent to any vertex from $\varphi (T^\prime )$ except $\varphi (u)$.

Assume it were and call the vertex $v$ is adjacent to $x$. Then, there exists a path in $G$ with endpoints $v$ and $x$ containing only edges from the embedding of $T^\prime$ because $T^\prime$ is connected. Together with the edge $\{v,x\}$ this path forms a cycle in $G$ on at most $k$ vertices since $T$ has $k$ vertices. This contradicts $g\geq k+1$. Thus, $\varphi^\prime (T)$ induces a subgraph isomorphic to $T$ in $G$.\qed
\end{prf}


The following results by Kierstead and Rödl \cite{Ki96} do not prove any cases of the Gyárfás-Sumner conjecture either. Nevertheless, they show the existence of a bounding function for the family of graphs $\textit{Forb}(T,K_{n,n})$ not containing an induced subgraph isomorphic to $T$ or $K_{n,n}$ for a tree $T$ and $n\in\N$. Despite being a weaker statement than the conjecture itself it proves quite useful in the following chapters: For proving or disproving the conjecture we only need to consider families of graphs $F$ such that for each $n\in\N$ there exists a $G\in\mathcal{F}$ inducing a $K_{n,n}$.

Before presenting their main theorem, we need to prove three preliminary lemmas. They use some hypergraph theory in their proofs, so we want to introduce it as well. Let $H=(V,E)$ be a hypergraph. A hypergraph $G=(V,E^\prime)$ is a \textit{covering hypergraph} by $H$ if for every edge $e\in E$ there exists an edge $e^\prime\in E^\prime$ such that $e^\prime\subseteq e$. 

They define a \textit{rooted hypergraph} as a triple $H=(V,E,r)$, where $(V,E)$ is a hypergraph and $r:E\to V$ a function, such that $r_e=r(e)\in e$ for all $e\in E$. We call $r_e$ the \textit{root} of $e$. The \textit{breadth} $b(H)$ of a rooted hypergraph $H$ is the smallest $b$ such that for every vertex $v\in V$ there exist at most $b$ edges $e_1,e_2,\dots ,e_b$ with $r(e_i)=v$, $i\in [b]$ and $e_i\cap e_j= \{v\}$ for $1\leq i<j\leq b$.

\begin{lemma}\label{l1cr}
If $G$ is a covering graph of a hypergraph $H$, then $\chi (H)\leq\chi (G)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{prf}
Any proper coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring of $H$.\qed
\end{prf}

\begin{lemma}\label{l2cr}
If $G$ is an oriented graph, $\chi (G)\leq 2\Delta^{out}(G) +1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{prf}
We prove this by induction on the number of vertices in $G$, say $n$. For $n=1$, $\chi (G) =1\leq 2\Delta^{out}(G) +1$ since $\Delta^{out}(G)=0$.
Let $n\geq 2$ and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with $\Delta^{out}(G)=k$. For the average out-degree $d_{avg}^{out}$ of $G$ holds \[d_{avg}^{out}=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{v\in V(G)}d^{out}(v)\leq\dfrac{1}{n} \cdot n\cdot k=k.\] Since each edge in $E(G)$ has exactly one starting vertex end one vertex it is pointing to, the average in- and out-degree of $G$ are equal. Thus, the overall degree of the vertices in $G$, $d^{all}=d^{out}+d^{in}$ averages at most $2k$. There exists a vertex $v\in V(G)$ with overall degree at most $2k$. Then, $G-v$ is a graph on $n-1$ vertices with maximum out-degree at most $k$ and therefore properly colorable with $2k+1$ colors by induction hypothesis. Let $c$ be such a proper coloring of $G-v$. Coloring every vertex of $G$ as in $c$ and $v$ with the color not used on its neighbors provides a proper coloring of $G$ with $2k+1$ colors.\qed
\end{prf}

Observe that for an oriented graph $G=(V,E)$, we can form a rooted graph $G^\prime =(V,E^\prime ,r)$ by setting $E^\prime =\{\{ x,y\} :(x,y)\in E \textit{ or } (y,x)\in E\}$ and for $\{ x,y\}\in E^\prime$, $r(\{ x,y\} )=x$ if and only if $(x,y)\in E$. Then, $\Delta^{out}(G)=b(G^\prime )$ and thus, $\chi (G)\leq 2b(G^\prime ) +1$.

\begin{lemma}\label{l3cr}
For a rooted s-uniform hypergraph $H$ $\chi (H)\leq 2(s-1)b(H) +1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{prf}
Let $H=(V,E,r)$ be a rooted s-uniform hypergraph. For each vertex $v\in V$, let $C(v)=\{ e_1,e_2,\dots ,e_n\}$ be a maximum set of edges such that $r(e_i)=v$ for $i\in [n]$ and $e_i\cap e_j = \{ v\}$ for $1\leq i<j\leq n$. Then, $n\leq b(H)$. Define an oriented graph $G=(V,D)$ with $D=\{(v,w): v =r_e \textit{ for some } e\in E\textit{ and } w\in e_i -\{v\} \textit{ for some } e_i\in C(v)\}$. Now, consider any edge $e\in E$. If $e\in C(r_e)$, let $w$ be any vertex in $e-\{ r_e\}$; otherwise there exists an edge $f\in C(r_e)$ such that there exists a $w\in (e-\{ r_e\})\cap f$. Then, $(r_e,w)\in D$ and $\{r_e,w\}\subseteq e$. An illustration of this construction is shown in Figure \ref{f3cr}.

Hence, $G$ is a covering graph of $H$. Since $\Delta^{out}(G)\leq (s-1)b(H)$, for the chromatic number of $H$ holds $\chi (H)\leq\chi (G)\leq 2(s-1)b(H) +1$ by the previous Lemmas \ref{l1cr} and \ref{l2cr}.\qed
\end{prf}

In the proof of the main theorem by Kierstead and Rödl they use an application of the Ramsey theorem not yet mentioned. Let $B=B(s,t,r)$ be the Ramsey function such that for any funtion $c:X\times Y\to [r]$, where $\vert X\vert =\vert Y\vert = B$, there exist subsets $X^\prime\subset X$, $Y^\prime\subset Y$ and a color $\alpha\in [r]$ satisfying $\vert X^\prime\vert = s$, $\vert Y^\prime\vert =t$ and $c(i,j) =\alpha$ for all $(i,j)\in X^\prime\times Y^\prime$. 

Additionally, we need to introduce the notion of oriented cliques and oriented $K_{n,n}$s since their proof works with directed graphs. Therefore, let $DK_{n,n}$ denote an oriented $K_{n,n}$ such that all arcs point from one part to the other part and $TK_m$ be the transitive tournament on $m$ vertices, i.e. an oriented clique $K_m$ such that we can order the vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots ,v_m$ in a way that every edge $(v_i,v_j)$, $i\neq j$, points to the vertex of higher index.

\begin{thm}[Kierstead, Rödl \cite{Ki96}]\label{t2cr}
For all $m,n\in\N$ and all oriented trees $T$, there exists a function $f=f(m,n,T)$ such that for every oriented graph $G$ the following statement holds. If $\chi (G)\geq f(m,n,T)$, then $G$ induces either $TK_m$, $DK_{n,n}$ or $T$.
\end{thm}

\begin{prf}
Let $G$ be an oriented graph. Observe that if $\omega (G)\geq m^\prime$, where $m^\prime = R(m,m)$, then $G$ contains $TK_m$. To see this, consider a clique of size $m^\prime$. Order the vertices of an oriented clique of size $m^\prime$ as $v_1,v_2,\dots v_{m^\prime}$ and choose a coloring $c$ with $c((v_i,v_j))=1$ if $i<j$ and $c((v_i, v_j))=2$ otherwise. By definition of the Ramsey number, we find a monochromatic clique of size $m$. The vertices in this clique induce a transitive tournament in $G$.

Second, note that if $G$ does not contain a clique of size $m^\prime$ but a $K_{n^\prime , n^\prime}$, where $n^\prime = R(m^\prime , B(n,n,2))$, $G$ induces a $DK_{n,n}$. Denote the parts of the $K_{n^\prime , n^\prime}$ as $A$ and $B$. We find stable sets of size $B(n,n,2)$ in both $A$ and $B$ again by the definition of the Ramsey number. After coloring all edges that point from $A$ to $B$ in the first color and all edges pointing from $B$ to $A$ in the second color, we obtain a monochromatic $K_{n,n}$ by definition of $B(n,n,2)$. Its vertices induce a $DK_{n,n}$ in $G$. 

Thus, it suffices to show, that $(\ast)$ there exists a function $g=g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T)$ such that every oriented graph $G$ with $\chi (G)\geq g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T)$ either has $\omega (G)\geq m^\prime$ or $G$ contains $K_{n^\prime ,n^\prime }$ or $G$ induces $T$. We prove this claim by induction on the number of vertices $v(T)$ of a tree $T$. 

The base case for $v(T)=1$ is trivial since a tree on one vertex is induced in every graph that has at least one vertex. 

Now suppose that $g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T^\prime )$ exists for all $m^\prime ,n^\prime \in\N$ and for all trees $T^\prime$ with $v(T^\prime )\leq s$. Let $T$ be a tree on $s+1$ vertices. We define a function $g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T)$ for all $m^\prime ,n^\prime\in\N$ so that $(\ast)$ holds as follows. Choose a leaf $l$ of $T$, which is adjacent to a vertex $u$ of $T$, and let $T^\prime = T- \{l\}$. Let $\sigma =$ \textit{in} if the edge between $l$ and $u$ points to $u$ and $\sigma = $ \textit{out} otherwise. Define $g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T) = 2(g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T^\prime )(s-1)+s)B$, where $B=B(n^\prime ,n^\prime ,s)$. We now show that $g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T)$ satisfies $(\ast)$. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph such that $\chi (G)\geq g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T)$, and suppose $G$ contains neither $K_{m^\prime}$ nor $K_{n^\prime ,n^\prime}$. We claim that $G$ induces $T$.

Let $W=\{v\in V:\delta^\sigma (v) <sB\}$. Then, by Lemma \ref{l2cr}, $\chi (G[W]) < 2sB$. Let $G^\prime = G[V^\prime ]$, where $V^\prime = V-W$. Since $\chi (G)\geq 2(g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T^\prime )(s-1)+s)B$ we need at least $2g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T^\prime )(s-1)B + 1$ colors for the vertices in $V^\prime$ in every proper coloring of $G^\prime$, i.e. $(\ast\ast)$ $\chi (G^\prime )\geq 2g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T^\prime )(s-1)B + 1$.

Next, construct a rooted $s$-uniform hypergraph $H=(V^\prime ,F,r)$ with the same set of vertices as $G^\prime$. An $s$-subset $S$ of $V^\prime$ is an edge of $H$ if and only if $T^\prime\approx G[S]$. Let $\phi$ be an isomorphism from $T^\prime$ to $G[S]$ and let $r_S$ be the image of $u$ under $\phi$. Note that in a proper coloring $c$ of $H$ no color class induces $T$. Thus, we can apply the induction hypothesis to each subgraph $H_C$ in $G$ that is induced by the vertices of a color class $C\subseteq V^\prime$ in $H$. Then, $\chi (H_C)\leq g(m^\prime , n^\prime , T^\prime )$ for each color class $C$. The union of all color classes contains every vertex in $V^\prime$. Thus, by coloring the vertices of each color class with its own set of colors, we get $\chi (G^\prime )\leq \chi (H)g(m^\prime ,n^\prime ,T^\prime )$. Together with $(\ast\ast)$, this yields $2(s-1)B +1\leq \chi (H)$.

By Lemma \ref{l3cr} $b(H)\geq B$ holds. Then, there exists a vertex $r\in V^\prime$ and a set of hyperedges of $H$, $Y = \{S_1,S_2,\dots ,S_B\}$, with $r(S_i)=r$ for all $i\in [B]$ and $S_i\cap S_j=\{r\}$ for all $1\leq i<j\leq B$. Let $S_i=\{r,y_i^1,\dots ,y_i^{s-1}\}$. Then, $\vert \bigcup_{i\in [B]} S_i\vert =1 +(s-1)B$. There are at most $(s-1)B$ vertices from $\bigcup_{i\in [B]} S_i$ in $N^\sigma (r)$ since $r\in \bigcup_{i\in [B]} S_i$ is not a neighbor of itself. Thus, we find a set $X\subseteq N^\sigma (r)$ with $\vert X\vert =B$ and $X\cap S_i =\emptyset$ for all $i\in [B]$ because $\vert N^\sigma (r)\vert\geq sB$. See Figure \ref{f4cr} for an illustration. 

Define the function $C:X\times Y\to [s]$ by setting $c(x,S_i)=s$ if $x$ is not adjacent to any vertex in $S_i-\{r\}$ and otherwise $c(x,S_i)=j$, $1\leq j\leq s-1$, where $j$ is the least index such that $x$ is adjacent to $y_i^j$. This is well-defined since $j$ can be at most $s-1$.

By the definition of $B$, we find sets $X^\prime\subseteq X$ and $Y^\prime\subseteq Y$ with $\vert X^\prime\vert = \vert Y^\prime\vert =n^\prime$ such that $c(x,y)=\alpha$ for all $(x,y)\in X^\prime\times Y^\prime$ and a color $\alpha\in [s]$. If $\alpha\neq s$, then $X^\prime\cup\{y_i^\alpha :S_i\in Y^\prime\}$ contains $K_{n^\prime ,n^\prime}$, which contradicts the choice of $G$. Thus, $\alpha = s$. Let $x\in X^\prime$. Then, $x$ is not adjacent to any vertex in $S_i \setminus \{r\}$ for any $S_i\in Y^\prime$ and $x$ is a $\sigma$-neighbor of $r$. Since $T^\prime\approx G[S_i]$ by an isomorphism mapping $u$ to $r$, $G[S_i\cup\{r\}]\approx T$.\qed

\begin{note}
It is a direct implication of this theorem that the family $\textit{Forb}(T,K_{n,n})$ is $\chi$-bounded. This can be easily seen by replacing the directed graph $G$ by the underlying undirected graph $G^\prime$.

We finish this chapter with a motivation for considering an oriented version of the Gyárfás-Sumner conjecture even if that is not part of this thesis. An oriented graph $H$ is $\chi$-bounding if there exists a bounding function $f:\N\to\N$ such that any oriented graph $G$ that contains a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ has chromatic number $\chi (G)\leq f(\omega (G))$, where in this case $\omega (G)$ denotes the size of the largest oriented clique in $G$. Before looking at specific cases note that we are only considering trees for which we know Conjecture \ref{c1cr} to be true. There actually exist some results for oriented stars and oriented $P_4$. Aboulker et al. \cite{Ab16} conjectured that every oriented star is $\chi$-bounding and proved the cases for $S_{k,0}$, $S_{0,l}$ and $S_{1,1}$ where $S_{k,l}$ denotes an oriented star with $k$ outgoing edges and $l$ edges pointing to the center vertex. 

Next, observe that all paths on less than four vertices are stars and therefore included in the previous case. Let $or(P_4)$ denote the set of all pairwise non-isomorphic oriented $P_4$. Then, $or(P_4)$ contains only four elements, which we denote as \[\rightarrow\rightarrow\rightarrow , \rightarrow\leftarrow\rightarrow , \rightarrow\rightarrow\leftarrow , \leftarrow\leftarrow\rightarrow\] where the arrows depict the orientations of the edges. For oriented $P_4$ Aboulker et al. \cite{Ab16} conjectured that only $\rightarrow\rightarrow\leftarrow$ and $\leftarrow\leftarrow\rightarrow$ are $\chi$-bounding. Chudnosky, Scott and Seymour \cite{CSS17b} extended these results and showed that both conjectures are indeed true, so we can state:

\begin{thm}[Chudnovsky,Scott, Seymour \cite{CSS17b}]
The following oriented trees are $\chi$-bounding:
\begin{itemize}
\item oriented stars,
\item the oriented paths on four vertices $\rightarrow\rightarrow\leftarrow$ and $\leftarrow\leftarrow\rightarrow$.
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

Note that most results concerning the oriented version of the Gyárfás-Sumner conjecture deal with the cases of oriented stars and oriented paths on four vertices. There is not much known beyond that.

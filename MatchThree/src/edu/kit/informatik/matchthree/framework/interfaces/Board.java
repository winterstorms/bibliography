/**
 * A rectangular square-tiled game board.
 * <p>
 * The board has a fixed number of rows and columns of <em>fields</em> which are
 * arranged in the shape of a matrix. It contains at least 2 columns and 2 rows.
 * The fields are identified by their row and column indices. The indices are
 * counted from the top left field starting with 0. A 3 by 3 field has the
 * following shape:
 * <table summary="" border="1px" cellpadding="5">
 * <tr>
 * <td>(0,0)</td>
 * <td>(1,0)</td>
 * <td>(2,0)</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>(0,1)</td>
 * <td>(1,1)</td>
 * <td>(2,1)</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>(0,2)</td>
 * <td>(1,2)</td>
 * <td>(2,2)</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * 
 * Each field can be empty or filled with one {@link Token}.
